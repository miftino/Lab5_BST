This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java. It includes functionality to insert, delete, search, and print the tree in level order.

## Features

- Insert nodes into the BST.
- Delete nodes from the BST, handling all cases (no child, one child, two children).
- Search for a specific value in the BST.
- Print the BST in level order.

## Files

- `Node.java`: Defines the `Node` class, representing a single node in the BST.
- `BinarySearchTree.java`: Implements the BST with methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and printing.
- `Main.java`: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate the functionality of the BST.
